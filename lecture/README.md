## Slides and links to recorded lectures

### Recordings

Unfortunately I have not been systematic about recording all of the lectures in this class.  (Frankly, I don't think watching the recordings will be a very good use of your time.)  Nonetheless, I will make an effort to record more of our lectures and post the links to whatever recordings I make below.
