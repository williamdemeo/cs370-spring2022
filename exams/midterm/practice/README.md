Midterm Preparation Advice
==========================

I recommend first and foremost to review all of the exercises from Homeworks 2--6, and the first 4 exercises of Homework 7.

You should know how to do all of the homework exercises mentioned above, but many of them are very easy and you may want to focus on the more challenging exercises.  In my view, the more challenging are the following:

Homework 2: 12, 13, 14.

Homework 3: 1(e)(g), 5

Homework 4: 3(b), 9 (especially part c), 11

Homework 5: 4, 9, 12

Homework 6: 3, 5, 6, 9

Homework 7: 1--4


Remarks:

Homework 2: Exercises 6 and 7 are also challenging, but only because (imho) the answers to these questions are debatable; in particular, I believe the correct answer to 7 (b) is MN choose K---that is, MN!/((MN-k)!K!)---which was not among the answer choices.  However, since I didn't explain this in class, I won't test you on it. Nonetheless, if anyone wants to explain, in a Canvas discussion post, why the answer should be MN!/((MN-k)!K!), then I would be happy to make this a problem on the exam, maybe for extra credit.

Homework 4: Exercise 7 is ambiguous because it's not clear whether the inequality is strict (<) or weak (â‰¤). Question 8 is nonsense (imho); skip it.

Homework 5: Exercises 5--8 are okay, too, but hopefully they're quite easy for you.

Homework 6: In the last part of Exercise 9, it might seem unclear which action (a) we should use.  Use West---the action that results in the highest Q-value.
