## CS 370 Spring 2022 at NJIT: Homework

Homework assignments should be submitted on Gradescope. The pdf files here are provided merely for the convenience of students, for practice or study purposes. They may not be used as a substitute for submitting homework on Gradescope.


### Homework Solutions

*You must not share homework solutions with anyone outside our class* (CS 370, Section 004, Spring 2022).
Doing so is a violation of the Student Code of Conduct, will be reported to the Dean of Students, and 
may be subject to severe punishment, ranging from a failing grade in this course to suspension or expulsion from the university.
